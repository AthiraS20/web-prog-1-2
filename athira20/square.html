<p>A square is a four-sided figure with equal sides and right angles measuring 90 degrees. Squares have two major properties: all sides are equal in length and all angles are 90 degrees. Additional properties include parallel opposite sides and classification as quadrilaterals, regular polygons, rectangles, and rhombuses.</p>
